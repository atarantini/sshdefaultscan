Install
=======

You will need to have `Nmap`_ installed. If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, this should
do all the work:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install nmap

On OSX you can install with Homebrew or macports:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install nmap

or

.. code-block:: bash

    $ port install nmap

Once you have `Nmap`_ installed, install dependencies from the ``requirements.txt``
file using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

If the project get some stars, I will upload it to the `The Python Package Index`_.
